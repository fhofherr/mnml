<!-- vim: set tw=72 ft=markdown: -->

This is a simple Almost Gemtext file consisting of a modeline and two
paragraphs. The most notable feature about the two paragraphs is that
each of them consists of multiple lines.

Additionally the modeline at the top, as well as any blank lines that
immediately follow the modeline, are omitted from the output.
