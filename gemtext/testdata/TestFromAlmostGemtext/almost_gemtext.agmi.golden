# Almost Gemtext

The `mnml` site generator uses an input format that is almost Gemtext [1]. Almost Gemtext is a slightly changed version of Gemtext which the author of `mnml` finds a little easier to use. At the same time all Gemtext documents are also valid Almost Gemtext documents, which `mnml` can process just the same.

This document specifies Almost Gemtext by describing the differences to Gemtext. At the same time the source of this document serves as an example of a valid Almost Gemtext document.

## Modelines

Some editors allow the use of so called modelines, basically a line at the beginning or the end of the document, which allow to set various editor settings. While not widely used this feature sometimes comes in handy. Therefore the Almost Gemtext parser ignores the first and the last line of a document if it starts with an HTML open comment symbol (`<!--`). The trailing close comment symbol (`-->`) is optional and not taken into account.

```
<!-- vim: set tw=72 ft=markdown: -->
```

Additionally all empty lines immediately following a modeline at the beginning of the document are dropped from the output.

## Headings

A line starting with one or more pound `#` characters is treated as a heading line. The amount of `#` characters at the beginning of the line defines the level of the heading.

Gemtext only allows three levels of headings. The same holds true for Almost Gemtext. Authors however may choose to use up to 6 `#` characters for their headings. This makes it easier to convert Almost Gemtext to Markdown.

`mnml` does copies heading lines verbatim to the output when converting from Almost Gemtext to another format.

## Paragraphs and Lines

The biggest difference between Gemtext and Almost Gemtext is the treatment of regular text lines. While Gemtext requires to use one line per paragraph, Almost Gemtext allows for line breaks within a paragraph of text. The following text is valid Almost Gemtext but not valid Gemtext:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse
nec dui rutrum, imperdiet risus sed, tempus elit. Ut sed dignissim mi.
Morbi maximus arcu at pulvinar euismod. Curabitur lacinia rhoncus metus,
sit amet tempor tortor faucibus ut. Sed efficitur dictum diam vitae
tristique.

Donec suscipit volutpat justo eu maximus. Fusce imperdiet sapien et
sapien lacinia vehicula. Quisque auctor felis eget dictum efficitur.
Donec ex risus, luctus in fringilla eu, vulputate tempor magna. Nunc at
sapien gravida elit bibendum finibus.
```

### Conversion to Gemtext

When converting from Almost Gemtext to Gemtext `mnml` joins all lines separated by a single newline character (`\n`). Two or more consecutive newline characters mark the end of a paragraph. `mnml` copies them verbatim to the resulting Gemtext.

## Quotes

Almost Gemtext lines containing a quote start with a `>` character, just like in Gemtext. Quotes that are to long to fit in one line may be broken up by inserting a single newline character followed by `>`. The following is an example of a valid Almost Gemtext quote spanning multiple lines:

```
> This is the first line of the quote,
> and this its second.
```

### Conversion to Gemtext

Just as with paragraphs `mnml` joins lines separated by `\n>` together. All intermediate `>` characters of the resulting line are removed. Only the very first `>` is retained.

## Pre-formatted Text

A line containing only three backtick characters marks the beginning of pre-formatted text. The next line containing only three backtick characters marks its end. This the same for Almost Gemtext and Gemtext.

In addition Almost Gemtext treats any lines indented by four space characters or a single tab `\t` character as a line of pre-formatted text. The first non-blank line that is not indented ends the block of pre-formatted text.

```
    This is pre-formatted in Almost Gemtext.

    This line is part of the same block of pre-formatted text in Almost
    Gemtext.
```

### Conversion to Gemtext

Pre-formatted text identified by backtick charactes is copied to the output verbatim.

Pre-formatted text that is identified by indentation gets its identifying indentation, i.e. four spaces or a single tab, removed. It is then wrapped in backticks and copied to the output.

## Lists and List Items

Lists in Almost Gemtext must have a paragraph of their own. This means the document must contain at least two newline characters before the first list item and at least two new line characters after the last list item. Alternatively the document may end with the last list item. In this case the terminating newline characters are optional.

```
Paragraph before the list.

* First list item
* Second list item

Paragraph after the list.
```

As with Gemtext list items in Almost Gemtext are identified with a single leading asterisk (`*`) character. In contrast to Gemtext lists in Almost Gemtext may span multiple lines. In this case all additional lines of the list item must be indented by two spaces.

```
* This is a valid Almost Gemtext list item.
  It spans multiple lines. All lines following the first line of the list
  item must be indented by two spaces.
```

The following is also a valid Almost Gemtext list item. Albeit one the author of this document finds less pleasing to look at:

```
*A list item spanning multiple lines.
  The indent by two spaces is a hard requirement. This may lead to ugly
  looking list items if the * is not followed by a space.
```

## Links

Links in Almost Gemtext work the same as links in Gemtext. A line starting with `=>` identifies a link. Inline links are not available.

### Conversion to Gemtext

`mnml` copies the links verbatim from Almost Gemtext to Gemtext.
