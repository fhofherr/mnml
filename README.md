# mnml

`mnml` is a minimalistic [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) and
[Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)) site
generator.

Its main purpose is to make cross-publishing for both protocols easy, by
converting from a common input format to the output format for the
respective protocol.
